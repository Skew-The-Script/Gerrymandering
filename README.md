# Exploring Gerrymandering Through Simulation
View and use the web applet here: [skew-the-script.github.io/Gerrymandering](https://skew-the-script.github.io/Gerrymandering/)

Our web applet uses simulation to find evidence of [gerrymandering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering) in state redistricting plans. The applet will be used in high school statistics classrooms as a part of [Lesson 6.1](https://skewthescript.org/6-1) in the [Skew The Script AP Stats curriculum](https://skewthescript.org/ap-stats-curriculum). The applet is currently in beta stage.

Simulation powered by [ALARM redist](https://alarm-redist.github.io/redist/) (by Christopher Kenny & Cory McCartan)

Our simulations are powered by ALARM's [redist package](https://alarm-redist.github.io/redist/). The R package randomly divides a state into compactly-shaped districts of roughly equal population size (while following all state laws for district drawing). Then, it uses prior election data to find the political lean of the simulated districts. Our applet allows high school students to use this powerful simulation technology, with only a few online button clicks.
